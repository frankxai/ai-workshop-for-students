## Frank's Agent Design Principles

*These principles come from Frank's experience building AI agent systems:*

### Principle 1: Clear Identity

> "An agent with a clear identity produces consistent, predictable results."

**How I apply this**:

### Principle 2: Defined Boundaries

> "Clear boundaries prevent scope creep and maintain focus."

**How I apply this**:

### Principle 3: Continuous Improvement

**How I apply this**:
- [Specific behavior]
