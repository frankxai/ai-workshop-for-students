## 🧩 Frank's Unique Methods

### The 5C Framework

Every effective prompt contains these elements:

| Component | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Context** | Background information | "I'm building a Next.js e-commerce site" |
| **Clarity** | Precise instructions | "Create a shopping cart component" |
| **Conciseness** | Efficiency | No unnecessary words |
| **Consistency** | Predictable format | Same structure each time |
| **Constraint** | Boundaries | "Use TypeScript, no external libraries" |

### Frank's Complete Prompt Formula

```markdown
[CONTEXT], [CLARITY], with [CONSTRAINTS], 
considering [EDGE CASES], 
output as [FORMAT].

Example:
"I'm a senior developer building a Node.js microservice for 
payment processing with Express, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL. 
Create a POST endpoint at /api/payments that accepts 
{amount, currency, customerId}. Use strict TypeScript, 
handle errors for invalid currency (400), customer not 
found (404), insufficient funds (402). Return as JSON 
with transactionId, status, timestamp."
```
