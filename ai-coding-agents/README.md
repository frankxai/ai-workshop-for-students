## The Transformation

```
BEFORE                              AFTER
──────                              ─────
Manual coding                   →   AI-augmented flow
Copy-paste from StackOverflow   →   Contextual AI assistance
Hours of debugging              →   Intelligent error resolution
Repetitive tasks                →   Automated workflows
Isolated tools                  →   Orchestrated agent systems
```
