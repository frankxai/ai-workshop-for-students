## 🧩 Frank's Unique Methods

### The 5-Layer Prompt Architecture

Frank's proprietary system for consistently excellent music generation:

| Layer | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Foundation** | Genre/Style | "Cinematic orchestral hybrid" |
| **Mood** | Emotional landscape | "Powerful and uplifting" |
| **Instrumentation** | Sonic palette | "Soaring strings, epic brass, taiko" |
| **Production** | Mix quality | "Wide stereo, film-quality" |
| **Intention** | Energetic purpose | "Courage to pursue bold dreams" |

**Complete Prompt Formula**:
```
[FOUNDATION], [MOOD], with [INSTRUMENTATION], [PRODUCTION], intention: [INTENTION], [TEMPO/FEEL].
```

**Example**:
```
Ambient electronic meditation, ethereal and transcendent, with crystal singing bowls tuned to 528Hz, soft synth pads, binaural theta waves, gentle wind chimes, spacious cathedral reverb, pristine production, intention: deep inner peace and heart healing, slow and drifting.
```

### Vibe OS Signature Styles

| Style | Tempo | Use Cases |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| **Conscious Electronic** | 60-90 BPM | Meditation, yoga, breathwork |
| **Epic Motivation** | 120-140 BPM | Workouts, presentations, launches |
| **Creative Flow** | 80-110 BPM | Deep work, writing, coding |
| **Frequency Healing** | <60 BPM arhythmic | Sleep, healing, transformation |

### Frequency Science Reference

| Frequency | Effect | Best For |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| 174 Hz | Pain reduction | Physical healing |
| 396 Hz | Liberation | Releasing fear |
| 528 Hz | DNA repair, love | Most popular healing |
| 639 Hz | Connection | Relationships |
| 741 Hz | Awakening | Intuition |
| 852 Hz | Enlightenment | Spiritual practice |
| 963 Hz | Divine consciousness | Deep meditation |
